This project aims to develop a pan-tilt gimbal system  mechanical video stabilization and target tracking. The objective is to design a system that is both robust against disturbances as well as agile and stable during object tracking. The system utilizes a mechanically balanced pan-tilt mechanism to counteract disturbances. The final design aims to achieve a rise time between 0.02 and 0.35 seconds, an overshoot percentage of below 2%d, and a settling time in the range of 0.19 to 0.4 seconds. The project aims to build a gimbal system that can provide stabilization and smooth tracking of dynamic objects.
