This project aims to develop a pan-tilt gimbal system for mechanical video stabilization and target tracking. The objective is to design a control system for an existing gimbal platform that is both robust against disturbances as well as agile and stable during object tracking. The system utilizes a mechanically balanced pan-tilt mechanism to counteract external disturbances typically originating from movements from vehicle traversing undulated road surfaces on which the gimbal shall be mounted. The performance of the system will be assessed in broadly two aspects namely: Stabilization and Vision based Tracking performance.
